\chapter*{Acknowledgements}
Firstly, I'd like to thank my supervisor Dr. Ruslan Mukhamadiarov for his guidance and support throughout this exciting project. I am also grateful to Prof. Steffen Rulands for giving me the opportunity to work on a topic that combines my interests in physics and computer science. I have gained a lot of valuable experience and knowledge during this project and in the \textit{smarticle meetings} this semester. 


I also want to thank Jonas Braun for our discussions about the project and most of all for drawing my attention to the Rulands group in the first place. 


Lastly, I'd like to thank CHECK24 for giving me the opportunity to use my powerful work laptop for the hardware-intensive training of the neural networks.
